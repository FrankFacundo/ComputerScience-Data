Whether you’re looking for security or more dynamic investments, OptiLife offers tailored solutions.

Structure the transfer of your estate

Take advantage of the security offered

The Cardif Lux Vie life insurance policy has a specific legal framework and allows you to transfer your estate securely and efficiently. It is also recognised abroad.

You can:

- Choose the beneficiary/beneficiaries of the policy based on your personal and financial priorities.
- Change the designated beneficiary/beneficiaries (with the exception of an "accepting beneficiary").
- Extend the length of your cover by taking out a joint life insurance policy, which unwinds on the death of the second policy holder.
