      " Julie, let's start with the case. Okay. Do you have a pen and paper? I do. I do. Okay, perfect. So actually, we're not going to help a business this time around. We're going to help the German federal government. Okay. They are reviewing their spending on social services. And as part of that, they're asked us to identify cost reduction opportunities within their child placement services. Okay. So let me tell you a bit more about child placement services. So in Germany, you have 105,000 children that I looked after by the central government. That means that their parents can't look after them because or their families because of abuse situation neglect, family dysfunction, stressful situation, or sometimes because the children are actually an accompanied asylum system. So that means they came to the country as asylum seekers without their family. So very, very difficult situation. Actually, the care of these children is not managed by the central government itself. It's managed locally by 400 districts in Germany. Okay. Each of those districts actually identify the children that may need care, assess their situation, decide whether care needs to be provided and funds and provide the care. 45% of the children are placed in foster homes, which are basically the private homes of people who are specially trained. They are certified caregivers and they look after those children, like if they were their own children. And for them, it's a make money out of it. It's somewhat a profession. And then you have 55% of children who are in residential care. So these are typically orphanage that are normally operated by private companies. Okay. Residential care is normally for children who have more severe cases. They require around the clock care, one-on-one, and it's often correlated with age. So basically, children who are a bit older are more difficult to look after and are more often needing residential care. Okay. In terms of cost, the cost of child placement in Germany has increased by 15% over the last five years. And I just don't know why we need to do something about it then. Exactly. So we were hired to identify those cost reduction opportunities. And the way we would like to start with that is by identifying what kind of factors are driving the cost of child placement in the local district. So take any local district, what are the main drivers, what are the main factors that are driving the cost? And then we can, after that, discuss how we could reduce them. Okay. Make sense. Just want to make sure I'm getting all the facts correct. Yeah. The climate is the German federal government. And even though they are, so they are in charge of the local districts, but the local districts are free to run the care on their own. Okay. So the way it works is the federal government is giving money to the local districts. Okay. And there's a formula which doesn't depend actually on the number of children being looked after. But it really depends on the child, the size of the district, what's the children population, given the local demographics are likely carries to be needed. And they give money. And then the district is free to spend more or to spend less. It's really their problem. Okay. And the student. But obviously, what's going on is the local districts are saying, hey, we need more money. And the federal government is like, well, you know, actually, we don't think you need because here are some cost reduction opportunities. We think you should pursue. And if you do those, then maybe we could give you more resources. But so we do have a role as a federal government in helping them find cost reduction opportunities. So they are the one we decided to spend the money. Okay. Excellent. So we'll investigate what factors are driving the increased cost and then potentially what we can do about it. Yeah. Making sure I get some of the numbers correct. We have about 105,000 children in Germany who are taken care of by those local districts. Is that correct? Yes. And we have about 400 local districts. They do two things. First is they assess the needs of the children and to they provide and fund for the care, which happens in two ways, either foster homes or residential care. We have 45% of kids in foster homes and 55% in residential care. It seems like residential care is probably going to be more expensive given that it's more severe cases and one-on-one. And foster homes are more families that just make some money from having children of need at home. Yeah, absolutely. Excellent. I think that makes sense. Can I take a couple minutes to think of the factors that drive the cost in those child-child placement services? Absolutely. Go for it. Thank you. So Julie, let me know when you're ready. Okay. Yep. Sounds good. So there are three factors that I would like to consider to identify the main drivers of the increased cost for the child placement services. The first one is... Sorry, let me interrupt you. So actually we're not looking for the drivers in increased cost. We're looking for the general drivers for the cost, not just for the increase. Get it? In general, what makes for the cost of those districts? In those districts, yes, in child placement. Okay. So there's three of them. The first one is the number of children that are in each district. The second one is how severe each case is. Here the assumption is the more severe the case to hire the cost. Yes. And the third one is the cost per service. And so between foster and residential care, there might be differences in how they operate. So within the first one, on the number of children, there are a number of drivers that could explain how many children go to and seek for this care. And the first one is or economic conditions. Yes, absolutely. There could be some like a change in government that makes for less social measures or benefits that lead parents to abandon, could encode their kids. Maybe the parents are not able to afford school. Do you think it's driven by government policies? It can be if the government, like we're thinking of Germany, which is more of a social government, for instance, than the US, where there's more care. But if the recent government decided to provide less benefits to parents or lower the help for. Okay. What else beside government policy could affect that? There is potential organizations or supports NGOs that are helping. Okay. That could be helping. Okay. Yes. For the number of children, there could be on the economic side, there could be also in general bad economic conditions that lead to unemployment. Okay. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Oh, get it. Okay. Back and within the number of children, another driver that could change how many kids or going to those districts could be the number of asylum seekers, as you were mentioning. If there's a conflict in the neighbor country, for instance, that could lead to more immigration and then more kids, children in need of help. There could be also back to the government, a new policy for border and immigration, and maybe more people come in that need more care. Yeah, certainly. And actually, I think we've seen some of that with the crisis in Syria recently. Yes. That has affect in Germany quite a bit. Yes. And France was too as well. And then a third driver of the number of children could be a potential epidemic going on. There is corona that can lead to effect, that can affect parents and leaf orphans that will need to be taken care of. There could be also issues of substance abuse that's usually linked with economics as we've seen with opioids recently, but there could be also alcohol or other other substances. And then the last one that could explain the number, how many kids go to those care is simply the birth rate. There might be again, government changes or social effects, social changes that make for more increased birth rate changes in family planning or anything. My second category was now that we've seen there's potentially a number of increase potential change of number of children. We also want to look at how severe the cases are when children come in, assuming again that the more severe the case to hire the cost. So potentially there are less early interventions than the earlier intervention will lead to children coming with less severe cases, which would cost less for instance. We would also. Yes. So those could be like programs that catch kids earlier on before they actually go in the streets and commit more offensive. Like issues. So another factors for the change of severity of cases could be a change in abuse. We were seeing here with the lockdown situation that we there increases and abuses at home because people are together. So that could be something there could also be less a change in the in the education programs around parenting and how to take care of the of the children. Yeah. And the last the third and last category I wanted to look at is how much it costs per service. Here we're looking really once we have the kids how much do we pay to take care of them. Yes. So one thing I'm thinking of is the location of those either foster of residential care, residential places. What do you mean by that? If they've moved from counterside to more downtown areas for some reason for medical for instance, it might increase the cost of rental or real estate. Yeah. Which might drive the over cost higher. Yeah. Second factor could be the mix between kids in foster and residential care. Yeah. It seems like residential is probably more expensive because there's more one on one care. Yeah. So if more kids are sent to residential care that will drive an increase in cost. Yeah. Next, next within that cost per service, I also want to look at the cost specifically for foster and specifically for residential care. For foster potentially there's costs associated with paying those families that are taking care of the kids. Yeah. We may be training those families as well. So there might have been a change in those costs. Yeah. And on the residential part I'm thinking of those companies, we probably hire private companies to run those places. So maybe they have increased their cost or their costs have changed. Yeah. I mean in both cases the way we do it is we give a cost per night per child. That's the basic formula. Understood. Okay. You know, you're right there is a few training costs with specific programs to involve families but that's not very significant compared to the cost per night. Understood. Okay. And potentially so potentially the labor could have increased that cost per night for residential care. So those are the overall three areas I would like to look at and first I think I would want to look at the number of children that are coming for those cares who are they where they coming from and how do they look what does it look like? Julie has just laid out her structure. Before that she asked a few clarifying questions. She used that time wisely. She clarified who of the federal government or the local district is in charge of child placement which was a little tricky to understand. She checked that she kept her correctly the most important numbers and facts that I shared in the prompt. This did not take long and it gave her confidence that she had a solid foundation to structure the case. Her structure was excellent. She broke down the spend between the number of children who need care, the severity of their cases, and the cost to provide the care. This approach meets the aim test. It will get her to the answer. It is Missy and it is Taylor to the case question. And then she shared many insights about each of the drivers in her structure. She pointed out how recent events could have impacted the cost of child placement in a given district. Finally she shared clear next steps. Now if I were picky there are a couple things she could have done better. First, before she introduced her structure, she failed to reiterate the question accurately. She said we were looking for the drivers of the cost increase. While actually we wanted to identify the drivers of the overall spend in a given district. Which is slightly different. Secondly, she could have been more organized at the second level of her structure. She had many great ideas but she had them in a random order. Despite this, that was a very strong start from Julie. Look, I think it is a very good start. It is a very good list. I agree with the broad factors you described. What we would like to find out is which one is responsible for this increase in cost. What is most likely to drive the cost of caring and local district. What we have done is we have compared the cost of different districts to try to see what drives this. Can you go to exhibit one? Tell me what you see here. Okay. This is interesting. We are looking at if there is a relationship between the number of children in care for a thousand children. How much we spend on child placement for we assume the same thousand children. As expected, overall we see an increase. The more children on care, the higher the spend. That makes sense. Yes, it totally makes sense. We would have expected this. However, it is not fully explained by the number of children. The R square is about 45%, which means that only 45% of the spend of child placement is explained by how many children are there. That is interesting. I would have expected a higher number. The graph also shows how the relationship for different types of districts. We have four categories. Preparise, not deprived and very deprived. If we look at the top two, so the prepars are not deprived. They all have over less children in care. They are more towards the left side. They are also very low in care. They have less children, but they pay less on average. What is your case? My first case is that probably more of the kids are in foster care than in residential. Why would that be? I would assume that there are less severe cases in more wealthy districts. That would make sense. Anything else you would note? If we look at the other two, the deprived and very deprived districts, I would have expected those to be on the upper right category. More children and spend. They are everywhere. It makes me think that it would be interesting to look more into these. The risk I am seeing is for deprived districts that have a low number of children in care and spend little for them. I am guessing those children are probably not well taken care of. There might be more who should be taken care of. There are probably some that are spending a lot. It would be interesting to see what is driving the rest of the spend on child placement. Yes, absolutely. What is your conclusion? Some of it makes sense. The more children spend, definitely a big driver for the spend on child placement. There are additional drivers that we should explore. Julie went through the first exhibit and she did an outstanding job. Instead of diving straining to the data, she gave herself a bit of time by describing what was displayed. She got it right, so I didn't have to step in. Then instead of getting lost in the details, she stated the obvious eye-level conclusion that the cost of child placement in a given district is correlated with the number of children in care. After this, she went deeper into the data to describe how economic deprivation affects the district spend. Here, she didn't stop at the fact. She remarked when her observation differed from her expectations. She used this to generate hypothesis about what might be going on. Finally, she stated what to look at next to get to the bottom of what's driving the cost of child placement. I had to prompt her to summarize her findings, but overall she did a great job. Actually, I agree with you. We have another exhibit to help us with that, which is exhibit 2. Can you have a look at this and tell me what you should? Okay, so exhibit 2 is showing the... Now we're breaking down the spend on child placement between foster and residential care. Yeah. And we're again looking at the relationship between the weekly cost per child and the spend on child placement. So I'm assuming that it's... Let me just clarify this with you. It's going to be the same dots placed on the top and bottom graph, just that different reasons. Absolutely. So we're just looking at within that district the kids in residential and within that district the kids in foster. Is that correct? So it's the same dot in the sense that we are on the vertical axis. We're looking at the total spend, whether people are in residential or foster. And then on the horizontal axis we're looking at the cost per week of a child in foster care and the cost per week of a child in residential care. And I put this as you know, whether that is driving the... And the answer is no, which is surprising. The or square in both cases are less than 10%, which means it's almost...it's definitely not a factor. But the other interesting thing to... So first insight here is that we're looking for another driver of the spend on a child placement. It's not the weekly cost in foster care or residential care, which means that it's probably more of the mix of the two. But by this I mean... Because we're seeing that the cost in residential care is about... Five times more than it is in foster care. Absolutely. So if the same district has 100 children and 99 of them are in residential care and only one is in foster care, that district is going to have huge cost as opposed to a district that has 100 kids, but only one in residential care and 99 in foster care. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so actually you're right. We find that overall the cost of child placement is driven in large part by the number of children, but there's very little we can do about this. Because as you said, you know, economic deprivation and there's a lot of factors that are much bigger than the scope of our work here. And if we look at the 55% missing, it doesn't seem to be the rate we're paying to our foster parents or to residential care providers that is driving the cost, but rather the mix between foster and residential. Yeah, absolutely. So in the first one you see what's driving this and why are we sending more kids... Why are there more kids in residential care? Is it really because they needed or are there other reasons why we have more potentially more kids in residential care? Julie did another great job here. Notice how she handled the beginning of her answer. She was a little confused about this child, but instead of asking a passive, what does it mean, type of question, she stated her understanding and asked me to confirm it. She's really best practice. She showed me that she's putting forward her ideas and driving the resolution of the case. As an interviewer, the last thing I want is to feel like I'm solving the case on behalf of the candidate. So again, really good behavior from Julie here. Then she immediately figured that the differences in overall spend are driven by differences in mix between foster and residential care. This is a conclusion that is difficult to draw from the data. And she got it independently and with impressive speed. She really gets a high mark on problem solving from doing this. Now, I would have liked Julie to wrap up that question by taking a step back and telling us what a findings means for the client and what she wants to do next. Because she didn't, I stepped in. Yeah, and actually what we found is there are many gistrix who are using residential care instead of foster care. Not because the kids actually need it. They're not severe cases, but what happens there's not enough places in foster care. That would explain it. I'd like to understand what could you do, you think, to increase the number of foster places in a given district. I'd like to hear as many ideas as possible. It's a tough one to crack. There are a few things I can think of to increase the number of foster places. First is probably get more families to welcome children. And then second is within the families that are already welcoming children. Potentially could they get more children, which I'm thinking could be good for their kids also to have someone else with them. And then maybe free up some space within those families by making sure we send the kids back whenever we take the kids out whenever it's within the don't stay. For recruiting more foster families, I would think of advertising more for it. Maybe just families are not aware of it. We could advertise around target families and thinking probably churches or school would be more likely to have families willing and interested in having children. We found that the families that tend to be more likely to foster our families who had kids before but the kids are now old enough that maybe they are left home or they are about to live home. We also often, these are people that can do with the second income. Maybe one of them is not working anymore. These are the type of families we see. And they probably have, which also means that they probably have experience raising kids, which is I would be more confident in their ability to help a kid in need than someone who's never had kids. And they probably have to have to do with their houses. First, we need to identify where they are and I'm guessing I would go to alumni association of high schools or schools around the age of the kids we need to send to. And then, and partner with the schools, we could also, I'm thinking we could train them. Maybe they're afraid of what it means to have a kid in need. Yeah, absolutely. I think it would be interesting to maybe train them more, offers support. Why do you think support is important? Oh, because those kids are probably more, need more attention than a regular kid. And it's also not your own. So you might be less in a nature to go and help. You might be willing, but if it's not your own, you might have a difficulty figuring out if you're the parent, your friend, you really have that with that kid. So I'm thinking that we're not interested in that. So love this is focused on recruiting, right? It's making the offering a bit more attractive to people. Yep, yep, and then if they want to go to on holiday's to maybe we can help cover during that time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically make it easier for those, for families who've never done it before, but had kids before to accept those kids in need. And in terms of the families who are currently getting welcoming kids, I would see if we can provide beds or some extra subsidies for getting kids. Maybe they only have one bedroom in guessing. Maybe there's room for a bedroom. The bedroom is a big, big part of it, right? Because you need one bedroom for kids. And oftentimes those families are, you know, state provided housing and they don't have enough space basically. Which might be difficult. Yeah. And I think that's something that I mentioned earlier was on maybe setting up a testing program or a way to figure out if the kid is ready to leave the foster family. Yeah. Or if they need to stay longer and I'm guessing maybe some kids are staying longer than needed. Yeah. And we'd have to be careful with this and evaluate the risk of sending the kids back and make sure that they, it's not too early. Yeah. But no, those are about the, that is my, yeah. Okay. So sounds good. Anything else? Not that I can think of. Well, there's one idea too if a big celebrity was to run that program or help or welcome a kid in need. That would of course be great for great publicity. I don't know any German. But it could be a politician or, yeah, or an actor. Maybe not a politician. I'm not sure that would make them want to do it. It's okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. Here I was testing Julie's creativity and she gave me many good ideas that were pretty specific and relevant to the case. She did so quickly without expanding and necessarily on each of them. Now, there are a few areas where she could have done a little better. One is that she missed the most obvious idea when she's to pay foster families more. In general, starting with the obvious is a good habit. Then she could have organized her ideas a little better. She didn't necessarily have to do it upfront, but there was an opportunity to wrap up the question by summarizing her ideas in a few broad categories. Look, I think it's, it's good ideas and actually I'd like to pick up on your, on your idea of offering additional support. So what we see just as a benchmark is in some countries such as the UK, as much as 80% of children are cared in foster care, and 20% in residential homes. So, you know, there's a lot of them at room we have, we feel. And we believe that by offering better support, like the ones you described, we could transfer some of the kids today that are in residential care into foster home. By having more places in foster home. Would we be, oh, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, go for it. I was just going to ask if we were going to shoot for that 80, 20 of the UK or maybe something a little bit more. Well, it seems like very ambitious, right? Yes. It would be a significant increase. Right now, so what we're seeing is the extra support would increase the cost of foster care by 10%. Okay. So that's one thing that's the investment we would make. The question I have for you is what's the proportion of children in the residential system that would have to be moved into the foster system for an average local district to decrease its child placement cost by 10%. Knowing that the new support will increase cost of foster care by 10%. Okay, so we are... that's a good idea to... like the good test to run. Just to make sure we want to see what percentage of kids we would need to move from residential to foster to lower the overall cost by 10%. Yes. Knowing that by doing this, we're also increasing the cost of foster by 10%. Absolutely. That's exactly right. Okay. I think there's a couple information I would lead from you. Yeah, I can show you some... I know. So you set 105,000 children in Germany are using the services and we have 400 districts. And so that will give me the average number of children per district, which is about 260 children per district. That's great. And then now I'll need to know how much we spend for foster and residential. Yeah. And you told me that there's 45% in foster care. Yes. And 55% in residential. Do we know how much we spend per kid on foster care for foster care in residential care? Yeah, I can give you a random number. Okay. So it's 30,000 euros per child in foster care. Okay. And 150,000 euros per child in residential care. Excellent. Okay. And given that we have... What I'm basically going to do is first calculate how much we're currently... The total current cost on average for a district. And then I'm going to see what that 10% decrease in cost objective would be. Yeah. And what that would mean in terms of number of kids, proportion of kids, we need to move. Does that sound good? That sounds good, yeah. Okay. So in terms of foster care, 45% of those 260 children, that's about 170. So I'm going to run that 220 kids in foster care. That sounds good, yeah. In residential, that's going to be the Delta. So 140 kids in residential care. Yeah. So we now know that for foster on average, we spend 120 times 30k is 3.6 million for a... For foster in residential on average is 140 kids times 150. And that is about 21 million for residential. Yes. So total of our current costs per district would be the sum of these two. So about 24.6 million. That's correct, yeah. Which means a target of 10% reduction would be 2.... About 2.5 million, 2.46. Yeah. Okay, but we need to add also to... I'm trying to basically calculate all of the costs that we need to save and see what that means in terms of number of kids. Absolutely, that's exactly right. And so we have to add two things for that target. It's not only the 10% we want to save, but also we need to factor in for that increase in cost for foster care. Absolutely. Well, well spotted. Which you said was 10% and so 10% we have 120 kids in foster care at 30,000 cases. So we have 10% that's 33,000 and 420 kids that's on average 0.36 million that we need to... That will increase in additional costs. So now our overall target becomes 2.82 million euro. We're going to take 2.8 million of our target. Now, to get the number of kids we need to move, I'm going to divide the overall target by how much we save for one kid that is moved from residential to foster. And basically when we do that move, we save the 150,000 that they're not spending in residential anymore. But we now replace this by the 33,000 that we're spending on foster, the 30 plus the 10%. So that delta is about 120,000 euros. Yes, we can run it to that. Okay. And so now all I have to do to get the number of kids we need to move is divide my 2.82 by my 0.12 million euros. That's about 28 divided by 1.2, about 23 kids that we need to move. That's correct. And you asked me not for the number but for the proportion. And so I just need to do 23 divided by how many kids that we have in residential, 140. 23 by 140 is about 16.0. And I'll just say 16% that we need to move. So that's good news. That's not a lot of kids we need to move for achieving a 10% reduction in costs. What do you mean by that? Why do you think it's not a lot? It is not a lot because it will get us from its third. Well, let me take that back maybe. It's a third of 60% of the residential care. Not actually how to figure out 16. What would that bring us to? We would be now at 40, at 50, 61 in foster care. Will we be 61 in foster care? I don't think so. Oh yes, it's actually right. It's 16% of that 55%. It's 23 kids, right? So now we have in foster. Well, it's really, yeah, it's so now in residential, we'd have a hundred and 17. And then in foster, we'd have a hundred and 43 kids. How does that look? How does that sound? I think to be able to know if it's feasible, I would have to look into exactly the make-up of the kids in residential. The kids in residential care would have to see if there is indeed 16% of kids in residential care who are not in full need of that residential care. And also can we attract 16%? Can we attract a track that's going to be a little bit more than 60, maybe like 20% more in foster families? Okay, okay. Well, I mean for me that sounds pretty positive because you know, in the UK there's a much higher number. Here that would have been getting to 55% of kids in foster, which is you know, way below the 80% achieved there. So, it's not reasonable, I think. So you actually maintain your client. Just one last thing is we are here looking at decreasing the cost by 10% when we know they have increased by 15%. So we'll have to see if there's additional things, if there are additional things we can do for that to reach that target. Here, I actually need to compute some numbers and she started really, really well. She rephrased the question to make sure she had the right goal in mind. She remembered information that I shared before and asked me what was missing. She talked me through her approach before starting to calculate. And then, while she calculated, she talked me through her operations. This is really important in a video conference setting because I can't see her paper and I could easily lose track. She calculated very well, very quickly and didn't miss a thing. So overall that was pretty outstanding. The only point at which she stumbled a little bit is when she tried to say whether the 10% target was achievable. She struggled to find the right benchmark and was not conclusive in her interpretation. Instead, she could have said, you need to move about 10% of the children to decrease cost by 10%. This means having about 55% of children in foster care. Given that the UK manages to place 80% of looked after children in foster care, this seems achievable. So overall, I was expecting a stronger interpretation. But I get out of this pretty confident of as Julie's numerical abilities. Yeah, I agree. Okay, so you're actually meeting your client and he's asking you Julie, what have you fun so far? Well, hello, Germany government. You asked us to look at what were factors driving the cost of child placement services in your country. And what we found is that there are mostly two drivers for those costs, the number of children who need that care. And also interestingly, the mix and the proportion of kids that are placed in residential care in foster care. Residential is about five times more expensive than foster care. So what can you do to lower those costs? A couple of things. But overall, shift basically children from foster to residential. We've identified that it is possible. By moving 16% of children from residential to foster, you would lower your cost by 10%. You could achieve this by increasing capacity for foster families and by potentially providing them support. So what I would, what we would, our team would like to look at in the next couple weeks, weeks is the feasibility of the smooth and what it means for the kids to families that are welcoming and what's the time frame that we can look at for putting this in place. That sounds good. Thank you so much. Thank you. Julie just wrapped up the case with a very solid conclusion. In a battle minute, she managed to share a recommendation and most of her findings as well as next steps. Now, I think she forgot to mention early in the conclusion the goal of the client, which was to achieve a 15% cost reduction. Because she omitted this, she didn't mention that we may need to look for additional cost reduction opportunities to reach our target. But otherwise that was excellent. Overall, on the basis of this performance, Julie is a clear hire for me. She did extremely well on all the dimensions that we commented on so far. Now, I haven't said anything about our case leadership, as well as our presence and communication. So let me share a few thoughts. First, she did well enough in terms of case leadership. But they were at times some room for improvement. I wish she had been a bit more systematic in wrapping up each section of the case, linking her findings to the case question and suggesting next steps. She didn't do it consistently. Second, I saw that presence was really good. She appeared really confident, and although I was not particularly engaging or smiley, it didn't draw off. Finally, in terms of communication, I thought she was concise to the point. I did feel she talked to me a little bit, but I'm going to put this on the video conference setting. She really picked up my points showing good listening skills. But she could have been better organized at times. She had a tendency to go into laundry list of ideas, which were all great, but again, giving it a little bit more structure would have helped. So that's it. Overall, that was a great interview from Julie.\n",
