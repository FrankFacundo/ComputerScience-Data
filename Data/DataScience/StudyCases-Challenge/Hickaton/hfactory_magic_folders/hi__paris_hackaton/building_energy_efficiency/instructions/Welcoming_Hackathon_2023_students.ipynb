    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the reduction of greenhouse gases and in particular CO$_2$ emissions has become a major issue for all private and public actors. This is a key point if we hope to meet the objectives of the 2015 Paris Conference on Global Warming (COP21) to limit global warming between 1.5°C and 2°C.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Recently, geopolitical issues have forced us to rethink our energy consumption to reduce our gas and electricity consumption. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">According to a 2021 study, buildings alone account for 44% of the energy consumed in France, ahead of the transport sector (31.3%), and the real estate carbon footprint accounts for 25% of France's GHG emissions.  It is therefore crucial to understand which levers can be used to reduce the consumption of buildings and renovate them efficiently.</p>\n"
