In PyTorch, `torch.stack` and `torch.cat` both combine tensors, but they differ in how they do it and their resulting shapes:

### `torch.cat`

- **Functionality:** Concatenates tensors along an existing dimension. The number of dimensions in the output tensor remains the same as the input tensors.
- **Example Use Case:** Adding rows/columns to an existing 2D tensor.

### `torch.stack`

- **Functionality:** Stacks tensors along a new dimension. The number of dimensions in the output tensor increases by one.
- **Example Use Case:** Creating a batch of tensors for further operations.

### Comparison Example

#### Using `torch.cat`

```python
import torch

# Creating two 2D tensors
tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Concatenating along rows (dim=0)
result_cat = torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dim=0)

print("Concatenated (torch.cat):")
print(result_cat)
print("Shape:", result_cat.shape)
```

**Output:**

```
Concatenated (torch.cat):
tensor([[1, 2],
        [3, 4],
        [5, 6],
        [7, 8]])
Shape: torch.Size([4, 2])
```

#### Using `torch.stack`

```python
import torch

# Creating two 2D tensors
tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Stacking along a new dimension (dim=0)
result_stack = torch.stack((tensor1, tensor2), dim=0)

print("\nStacked (torch.stack):")
print(result_stack)
print("Shape:", result_stack.shape)
```

**Output:**

```
Stacked (torch.stack):
tensor([[[1, 2],
         [3, 4]],

        [[5, 6],
         [7, 8]]])
Shape: torch.Size([2, 2, 2])
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Dimensionality:**

   - `torch.cat` keeps the same number of dimensions.
   - `torch.stack` increases the number of dimensions by one.

2. **Output Structure:**
   - `torch.cat` simply combines the input tensors along an existing dimension.
   - `torch.stack` groups the input tensors into a new dimension, stacking them.

Choose between `torch.cat` and `torch.stack` depending on whether you need to concatenate data within the existing dimensions or create a new dimension to hold a set of tensors.
