### Understanding `torch.stack`:

`torch.stack` is a function in PyTorch used to concatenate a sequence of tensors along a new dimension. All tensors must have the same shape. Here are some examples to illustrate how `torch.stack` works:

#### Example 1: Stacking Vectors

Suppose we have three 1-dimensional tensors (vectors):

```python
import torch

# Three vectors of length 3
a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])
c = torch.tensor([7, 8, 9])

# Stack them along a new dimension
stacked = torch.stack([a, b, c], dim=0)
print(stacked)
```

Output:

```
tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]])
```

Here, `torch.stack` has stacked the three vectors along a new first dimension, resulting in a 3x3 matrix.

#### Example 2: Stacking Along a Different Axis

If we want to stack them along a new last dimension instead:

```python
# Stack along the last dimension
stacked = torch.stack([a, b, c], dim=1)
print(stacked)
```

Output:

```
tensor([[1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 8],
        [3, 6, 9]])
```

This changes the orientation by stacking each element of the vectors along the columns, resulting in a transposed effect relative to the first example.

### Application to the Original Code:

In your specific code snippet, `torch.stack` is used with `axis=-1` which means stacking along the last dimension. This method aligns each embedded input side by side in the last dimension, preparing a structured format that might be used for sequences in a recurrent neural network or any model that processes these embeddings sequentially. This stacking is crucial for maintaining the temporal integrity of the input features as it flows through the layers of a neural network model.

Let's explore the `torch.stack` function using two-dimensional tensors this time. This will help illustrate how tensors are stacked along different dimensions in a more complex scenario. We'll define three 2D tensors (matrices) and stack them along three different dimensions (`dim=0`, `dim=1`, and `dim=2`).

### Setup:

Here are three 2D tensors \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the demonstration:

```python
import torch

# Three 2D tensors (2x3 matrices)
a = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = torch.tensor([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
c = torch.tensor([[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])
```

### Example 1: Stacking along dimension 0

Stacking these tensors along `dim=0` will place them one after another along a new first axis:

```python
stacked_dim0 = torch.stack([a, b, c], dim=0)
print("Stacked along dimension 0:\n", stacked_dim0)
```

Output:

3D tensors (3x2x3 matrices)

```
Stacked along dimension 0:
 tensor([[[ 1,  2,  3],
          [ 4,  5,  6]],

         [[ 7,  8,  9],
          [10, 11, 12]],

         [[13, 14, 15],
          [16, 17, 18]]])
```

Here, each matrix becomes a separate block in the new tensor, and the result is a 3D tensor of shape \([3, 2, 3]\).

### Example 2: Stacking along dimension 1

Stacking these tensors along `dim=1` will concatenate them along the rows (second axis of the original tensors):

```python
stacked_dim1 = torch.stack([a, b, c], dim=1)
print("Stacked along dimension 1:\n", stacked_dim1)
```

Output:

3D tensors (2x3x3 matrices)

```
Stacked along dimension 1:
 tensor([[[ 1,  2,  3],
          [ 7,  8,  9],
          [13, 14, 15]],

         [[ 4,  5,  6],
          [10, 11, 12],
          [16, 17, 18]]])
```

The stacking resulted in a 3D tensor of shape \([2, 3, 3]\), where each row from the original tensors has been stacked vertically within each 2D slice.

### Example 3: Stacking along dimension 2

Finally, stacking these tensors along `dim=2` places them side by side within the innermost dimension:

```python
stacked_dim2 = torch.stack([a, b, c], dim=2)
print("Stacked along dimension 2:\n", stacked_dim2)
```

Output:

3D tensors (2x3x3 matrices)

```
Stacked along dimension 2:
 tensor([[[ 1,  7, 13],
          [ 2,  8, 14],
          [ 3,  9, 15]],

         [[ 4, 10, 16],
          [ 5, 11, 17],
          [ 6, 12, 18]]])
```

This results in a 3D tensor of shape \([2, 3, 3]\), where each element of the rows is now grouped with its corresponding elements from the other tensors.

These examples demonstrate how `torch.stack` can be used to combine multiple tensors into a higher-dimensional tensor by creating a new axis at the specified dimension. Each example alters the structure of the combined tensor in a distinct way, influencing how the data is organized and accessed for subsequent computations.
